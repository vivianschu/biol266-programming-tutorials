# Tutorial 1 - The Command Line/Unix

On the more popular operating systems like Windows or Mac, we typically use our mouse or trackpad to click on icons to access files and applications. However, there are many other ways for us to communicate with our computers. The command line is a text-based interface that is quick, powerful and straight-to-the-point. It allows users to communicate with their computers or files directly. In other words, you can navigate to, open and modify files and folders on your computer without your mouse!

Unix is an operating system (similar to Windows or Mac OSX). It's made up of three parts: the <i>kernel</i>, the <i>shell</i> and the <i>programs</i>. 

#### If you're curious to know:

`kernel` - operating system hub which allocates time and memory to programs; handles file storage and system calls

`shell` - the interface between the user and the kernel; the command line interpreter (CLI) which interprets the user's commands and carries them out

`programs` - commands
